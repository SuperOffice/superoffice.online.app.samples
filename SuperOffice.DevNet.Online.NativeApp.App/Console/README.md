# Native Console App

This samples includes a predefined client_id for testing purposes. 

When you register a new client application, as a native app, remember to define a redirect URI as `^http://127.0.0.1\:\d{4,10}$`.

If you use the Developer Portal wizard, this should already be set as the default.
